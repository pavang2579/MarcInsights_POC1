0,Method of Automatic Creation of Curriculum with a Competency-Based Learning Model,"The reality of digital economy changes rapidly and sets flexible, modular and asynchronous structure of the training process, to prepare specialists possessing the necessary professional competence. At the same time, the bachelor’s program must meet the requirements of regulatory documents. Therefore, an educational institution needs an automated development of individual curricula that ensure formation of relevant competence through student’s participation in various forms of educational activities, including electronic courses. This work aims at creation of an information model of the curriculum allowing to automate the process of curriculum development in the framework of the competence-based learning approach. The proposed model is based on competence maps as a part of educational standard describing the disciplines of the curriculum in terms of ensuring the development of professional competences of a future specialist. Using these maps Competences and Disciplines matrices are built. The model curriculum is implemented as a three-dimensional array and curriculum requirements are formalized using the apparatus of Boolean algebra. A method proposes an automated curriculum development by constructing corresponding arrays of Boolean vectors allowing to develop the curriculum that forms the competence of a specialist in line with the requirements of regulatory documents."
1,An Affective Tutoring System for Massive Open Online Courses,"In the last years, the concept of Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is widely regarded as new, innovative and creative model for free online learning at large-scale participation from the most prestigious universities around the world. On the other hand, the intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have been developed to support one of the most successful educational forms “individual teaching”. Recent researches demonstrate that emotions can influence human behavior and learning, as a result, a new generation of ITS is born, that is Affective Tutoring System (ATS). However, there is no study showing the importance of using ATS in MOOCs. Therefore, this paper presents a novel approach for developing an affective tutoring system for the MOOCs, which is called ATS-MOOCs. Such system can easily help students to improve their learning performance by recognizing their affective states and then adapting the MOOC content accordingly. A prototype was developed and a case study was presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach."
2,E-Learning Readiness of Technology Institutes in Ethiopian Public Universities: From the Teachers’ Perspective,"In this paper, we have presented an empirical study that aimed to investigate e-learning readiness of technology institutes in Ethiopia. Data was gathered from five technology institutes of Ethiopian universities. 400 teachers were sampled using simple random sampling method. An E-learning readiness level of those institutes has been assessed from the teachers’ perspective. In terms of employee readiness, academic institutions have achieved the heist readiness index in general. This indicates that teachers are ready to go ahead for implementing e-learning. Particularly, employee readiness parameters like technical skill, awareness and attitudinal readiness were found to be above the expected level of readiness. Whereas, organizational readiness in general was found bellow the expected level that indicated academic institutions are not ready and needs some work to get ready. Particularly, all organizational readiness parameters like cultural, policy, top management and technological readiness were found to be below the expected level of readiness."
3,Empirical Investigation of Usability Evaluation Methods for Mobile Applications Using Evidence-Based Approach,"Mobile learning or m-learning is novel learning medium, and consequently, there is a lot of research required to design usable m-learning applications. With the advent of new m-learning applications and their indulgence in imparting education, it poses new usability challenges. M-learning has to be investigated from various perspectives for its effectiveness and efficiency. So to have an effective and usable m-learning application, it is quintessential to discover an appropriate set of usability evaluation methods [UEMs] to evaluate the usability of m-learning application. For the aforesaid purpose, an evidence-based study of UEMs is carried out in this paper to compare and then assess different UEMs. To bridge the gaps between research evidence and software development practices and to avoid expensive and ineffective decision making during application development, an evidence-based approach is suggested by [ 1 , 2 ]. Evidence-based study is the process of systematically finding, evaluating, and using contemporary research conclusions as the basis for decision making. An evidence-based study is required before the adoption of UEM/UEMs because sufficient evidences should be gathered as a decision factor before testing an application. This study presents an empirical analysis for selecting effectual UEM(s) for a set of mobile learning applications using evidence-based approach [EBA]."
4,Gamification in Anatomy Education,"Gamification of anatomy education has the potential to enhance learning and involves the inclusion of a reward structure, narrative, sense of progression and competition or cooperation in their learning. Gamification of anatomy has been used in both digital forms, such as web-based simulations, virtual reality and augmented reality, and non-digital forms including board games, card games and gameshow formats. The creation of an educational anatomy game is an iterative process which should involve students from an early stage. Evaluation and pilot testing should inform game design. Inspiration for ideas for gamification can come from the leisure activities common to students or educators. Creating a narrative can be a powerful way of linking the learning tasks which constitute a game together. In other aspects, gamified learning is similar to other forms of learning, and attention should be paid to learning outcomes and pedagogy. Gamification can produce engaging and stimulating tools for learners of anatomy."
5,Learning Through a “Route Planner”: Human-Computer Information Retrieval for Automatic Assessment,"This chapter presents innovative technologies for enhancing web-based strategies available to educators willing to enhance students’ self-paced and self-regulated learning processes for scientific education. Various strategies for clarifying and disseminating shared resources and structured domain models help human experts in planning appropriate educational paths for individual learners: the chapter focuses on methodologies for organizing automatic assessment resources on top of natural language metadata. Learning management systems enable interaction, content integration, and communication via collaboration tools; they are environments where instructors expand formative assessment and web-based teaching strategies in virtual communities of practice. System integrations enable to organize and dispatch digital contents: clustering techniques, formal concept analysis, natural language processing, and knowledge representation models are new means for adaptively providing students with online activities. Theoretical bases from up-to-date studies for augmenting human-computer interaction at community level start from a generic framework for e-learning systems, up to practical implications and potential of related researches."
6,A Connectivist View of a Research Methodology Semantic Wiki,"The use of virtual learning spaces for learning and teaching needs to be underpinned by a pedagogy that provides a basis for the approach used. Connectivism takes a networked view of knowledge; its characteristics and understanding of learning were investigated. Here, the structure and development of a research methodology semantic wiki are described, including how the contents of the wiki allowed for the exploration of the structures of various research methodologies. Positive evaluation of the wiki was obtained from our research students."
7,Curriculum for Digital Culture at ITMO University,"In many scopes of human activities, both personal and professional, new digital tasks are emerging every day. The new educational module “Digital Culture” at ITMO University aims at building digital competencies of university students, both bachelors and masters, that is to teach students the existing approaches and methods of tasks solving, as well as to show them data processing and analysis techniques to implement in the future in their professional fields. Apart from conducting data analysis, the graduates are supposed to know how to interpret the obtained results correctly and how to navigate in the digital space easily. The disciplines of the first two years of study have been already introduced in the educational process of ITMO University both in bachelor’s and master’s degree programmes. This paper presents the curriculum content, the learning method and the results of the first years of the educational module. The disciplines of the module received positive feedback from both students and external experts in the intercollegiate seminars on digital education."
8,For Which Type of Students Does the Inverted Classroom Model Work Out?,"Although the concept of inverted classroom has gained increasing attention in academic teaching, it is still unclear for which type of students inverted classroom models (ICM) really work out. The purpose of our study is to analyse the impact of ICM on the improvement of learning success for different student types. Therefore, our research provides answers to the following research questions: For which type of students does ICM really work out regarding their learning success? Whether and how far do ICM need to be adapted in order to meet the individual needs of heterogeneous student groups? An empirical study with 178 cases was conducted in four courses that have adopted ICM at an University of Applied Science in Germany. Based on five different learning behaviours, three different learning types were identified. Students showing particular learning behaviours need additional, but discriminative support for their learning success. The insights of this paper help to modify the concept of ICM so that it satisfies the needs of different types of learners."
9,Integration of TeSLA in Assessment Activities,"During Large Scale Pilots of the TeSLA system, teachers in six European universities constructed case studies of the use of the TeSLA instruments in assessment activities in authentic courses. A thematic analysis of these case studies identified seven common categories of TeSLA instrument use, which varied according to the design of the assessment activity and the teacher’s purpose in seeking to authenticate student identity and/or check the authorship of assignments. These seven categories are described in detail in this chapter. These descriptions are intended to provide a starting point for teachers new to the use of student authentication and authorship checking instruments to identify appropriate ways to integrate the instruments in assessment activities in their courses. The chapter goes on to identify some of the issues arising from the context of the collected data and implications of the study for the future implementation of TeSLA and similar systems incorporating instruments for student authentication and authorship checking."
10,"Digitalization in Education: Challenges, Trends and Transformative Potential","Digitalization is transforming all facets of society, not just work environments, and in terms of educational contexts, the transformation is occurring with or without strategic initiatives that ensure ongoing quality of teaching and learning environments. Integration of technology into teaching and learning is not new, but the rapid rate and pace of technological advancement is new, especially regarding new Internet, ICT and digital technologies. The field of education is mainly reactive, as new disruptive technologies develop in other industries and are then applied and accommodated into existing educational cultures and systems. This chapter provides an overview of technology integration in education from computers to other more advanced forms of digital technologies. The transformative potential of digitalization in education is exciting and presents many opportunities and challenges, given new trends and developments in digital technologies."
11,Students’ Perception of Distributed Teaching Presence in Discussion Forums. A Case Study,"The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have been implemented regularly in faculty classes in the last two decades. ICT—mediated learning environments have the potential to transform educational practices as well as students’ learning experiences. Online discussion forums are useful to share graduate students’ opinions and the social construction of knowledge. The objective of this chapter is to analyse the distributed teaching presence as reflected in university teachers’ contributions through their inputs in the forums of a faculty teaching course. A qualitative research study was conducted to analyse two online virtual courses at the Technological University of Pereira (Colombia). Main results indicate that participants’ tended to solely present their own visions, ideas and understandings, but did not compare them with other participants, which had the effect of missing the communicative and interactive potential of e- and b-learning. Trascending the traditional teaching approaches based on transmission of content and entering into a more constructive and interpersonal communication is key for a proper use of this type of teaching."
12,Einsatzmöglichkeiten Künstlicher Intelligenz in der Hochschulbildung – Ausgewählte Ergebnisse eines Systematic Review,"Bereits seit über einem halben Jahrhundert wird zur Entwicklung von Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) geforscht und entwickelt. Durch die weltweite Vernetzung und Verfügbarkeit von Daten („big data“) und eine entsprechende Rechenkapazität der Computer sind heute Anwendungen und Methoden möglich geworden, die in den letzten Jahren verstärkt auch im Kontext des Lernens und Lehrens an Hochschulen diskutiert werden. Auf der Grundlage eines Systematic Reviews mit 146 inkludierten Studien wird in dem Beitrag ein Überblick über aktuelle Entwicklungen und potenzielle Anwendungsbereiche von AIEd (Artificial Intelligence in Education) gegeben. Hierbei wird auch eine kritische Perspektive zu den hiermit verbundenen ethischen und rechtlichen Herausforderungen eingenommen."
13,Educational Networking: A Glimpse at Emergent Field,"As a sample of the evolution that characterizes twenty-first century education, diverse Technology-Enhanced Teaching and Learning (TETL) approaches emerge, where educational networking (EN) is relevant. In this context, Web 2.0 represents a suitable environment to foster the creation, usage, and growth of online social networks (OSNs) that enable users to meaningfully connect, create, contribute, and collaborate in pursuit of common affairs, such as education. Hence, EN represents more than a platform for advertisement, breaking news, message dissemination, and content sharing, as it merges OSN functionalities with learning resources and its tools suitable for online teaching to instill social learning for all . Although EN is an incipient field in vigorous progress, it represents a new fashion of e-learning settings that gregariously transforms and spreads education worldwide. This is why a review of the evolution of EN labor and recent achievements leads to appreciate its nature, development, impact, and trends to consider its exploitation as part of an extended and novel academic offer. Thus, in this chapter a sample of works published since 2015 up to date is analyzed to shape a landscape of the endeavors performed in the EN arena. Therefore, a taxonomy for EN is designed to report a summary of the EN labor, whose features are outlined through a pattern to depict EN applications. The work reveals that most of the publications study how OSNs affect students’ learning, attitudes, and behavior, and general-purpose OSNs represent the most demanded platforms to foster EN."
14,NEOBOOK: Hypermedial Language Integrating Knowledge in Computer Education,"The objective of this research project was to analyze the use of Neobook to improve the academic performance in the teaching-learning process of Computer Science. In order to determine this, the survey technique was used specifically with its instrument, the questionnaire, applied to 84 students and 2 teachers of the Ing. Federico Páez School located in Cantón Otavalo, Parroquia El Jordán, of the City of Otavalo – Ecuador. A quantitative research was carried out, within a documentary, descriptive and field-work focus making it possible to demonstrate that when using this educational software, 82% of the students would improve their knowledge. Also, 100% of the teachers answered that their students would improve their academic performance. This is why an E-book was elaborated that handles a hypermedial language integrator of computer knowledge in order to strengthen their learning and develop their skills. The results address educational technology allowing cognitive construction and permitting new ways of learning digitally. Teachers using an E-book obtain an excellent sustainable teaching material for their classes, invigorating learning potentials in an interactive, constructive and collaborative way. It is also a contribution since it is a sustainable environment-friendly material."
15,Artificial Intelligence as Driver for Business Model Innovation in Smart Service Systems,"Artificial Intelligence drives business model innovation. In this context, our paper examines major amendments of business model elements (value proposition, value creation and value capture) due to artificial intelligence implementation into products and services. Based on a literature review changes like enhanced autonomous and adaptive value proposition, intense use of data and stronger collaboration in ecosystems as well as adapted revenue models are identified, analyzed and presented in this paper."
16,Mobile Technologies in Education: Student Expectations – Teaching Reality Gap,"In the world where mobile technologies are generally available to the majority of population, there is an obvious demand to make use of them in education. But, despite the fact that there is no lack in creative ideas on how to incorporate them in the learning process, most formal educational systems do not specifically support nor encourage teachers to use mobile devices in their teaching. As a result, there is a discrepancy between the expectations of students and working practices of teachers. The paper intends to discuss this discrepancy using the data of the surveys on the implementation of mobile learning conducted among the students and teachers of Tambov State Technical University (Tambov, Russia)."
17,An Intelligent Platform for Offline Learners Based on Model-Driven Crowdsensing Over Intermittent Networks,"Despite the continuous growth of global Internet users, almost 4 billion people do not use the Internet. The offline population includes people who live in developing regions or rural aging communities. In this context, we propose a learning-support platform for learners without an easy, reliable, and affordable means to access digital learning environments on the Internet. Unlike existing systems that provide little support for efficient educational data collection from offline learners, our proposed platform combines delay-tolerant networking mechanisms and active learning-based model-driven crowdsensing techniques to deliver learning materials and collect educational data efficiently."
18,Collaborative Learning and Patterns of Practice,
19,Higher Education Institutions Towards Digital Transformation—The WUT Case,"New emerging digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality, cloud computing, blockchain, robotization, the Internet of Things, big data, etc. have produced a powerful disruptive effect in almost all areas of our existence and have radically changed the way we live, work, learn or relax. Without consciously realizing it, everyone is adapting to the digital era. As nothing “escapes” the all-encompassing digital transformation, higher education follows track too. So, it is natural to ask ourselves: what are the higher education institutions doing to keep up with this rapidly evolving digital world? In this paper, we present the case of West University of Timişoara as an example of good practice in dealing with the effects of digital transformation on the university and its academic community (teachers, students, administrative staff). Our goal is to gain an understanding of what is being proposed through the institutional development strategy, and what is actually happening in our university from the digitalization perspective. Thus, we conduct an exploratory research using a quantitative approach that involves a survey applied to students enrolled in different study programs, at different levels. We focus on their opinion about how our university can prepare and transform in order to adopt an integrated digital approach, looking into topics like: technology-enabled services, digital enrollment of students, digitization of the administrative processes, implementation of digital procedures to offer recommendations or file complains, digital curricula, new modes of digital learning delivery, etc. Our findings reveal that West University of Timişoara must take significant steps towards the implementation of digital transformations, while, however, remaining watchful and cautious of the hidden implications of this process."
20,Interplay Between Usability and Information System Continuance: An Extended Model,"This paper proposes a model to investigate the relationship between Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM) widely used in Information System (IS) research and main usability factors. The target domain is CRISS platform that represents a unique cloud-based digital learning platform, based on the most advanced pedagogical methodologies and technological solutions, that allows guided acquisition, evaluation and certification of digital competences in primary and secondary schools. Based on the research model, a survey instrument to measure the user’s continuance intention of using the CRISS platform is also developed. Such model and the instrument can help researchers to explain the expected sustainability of an IS, and to enrich the understanding of its post-adoption use. Also, the study results contribute to the current knowledge of ECM and usability field in terms of other factors other than the original affecting the users’ intention to use a digital platform for assessment and digital competence acquisition."
21,"Blended Learning: Approaches, Trends, Research, and Publication Opportunities","This chapter focuses on blended learning approaches, trends, research, and publication opportunities. It begins with a discussion about campus-based and fully-online approaches to blended learning. Research trends are then described from student, faculty, and administrative perspectives. Research opportunities and challenges are presented for each of these three categories. The chapter concludes with an overview of the resources, conferences, and publication venues that are available in the field of blended learning."
22,Integra(c)tion of Graphic Supports. A Case-Study on Parabolic Motion for Students with Learning Difficulties,"What opportunities do technological and digital resources provide for teacher mediation in case of learning difficulties? Starting from the findings on teaching accommodation (Hodge and Preston-Sabin 1997 ; Tomlinson and Murphy 2015 ) and multimodal strategies (Walters 2010 ; Kress 2001 , 2010 ), a case-study on the ‘integration’ of three graphic supports (Mayer 1989 , 2005 ; Clark and Lyons 2010 ) (algebraic function formula; representation on the Cartesian plane; dynamic representation through interactive software - GeoGebra) will be described. The study regards the teaching integration of these graphic supports for the representation of a parabolic motion in a secondary school class that includes students with dyscalculia. Through the triangulation of questionnaire, document analysis and in-depth interviews, the analysis highlights relevant aspects regarding the integration of visual and motor representation of learnings (Eilam 2015 ), in order to support the learning difficulties. These early findings confirm the meta-analyzes already known (Hattie 2012 ), the necessity to invest in the multimodal competence of the teacher (Bruce et al. 2013 ) and lead us to deepen the effective relationship between digital resources and learning difficulties."
23,Indications for Kinesthetic Learning Through Haptic Devices,
24,An Exploration of a Social Media Community: The Case of #AcademicTwitter,"Online professional communities on Twitter are increasingly gaining attention among users due to benefits such as knowledge sharing, professional development, and relationship building. Millions of hashtags are used every day in different disciplines (e.g., #educhat) or everyday situations (e.g. #MondayMotivation). Hashtags have led to the creation of conversations about topics (e.g., #highered), serving as a point of connection among different types of users. In the academic world, the hashtag #AcademicTwitter has evolved into an online community of educators, graduate students, organizations, and others engaged in the discussion of topics and issues related to academic life, funny moments, and survival stories. This paper examines participants and communication patterns in the #AcademicTwitter community. Using content analysis and social network analysis techniques, the researchers examined tweets including the #AcademicTwitter hashtag to discover the community’s network properties, roles of the participants, sentiment, and conversational themes. Findings indicated that the conversation was not centered on one topic, instead several micro-communities were found. Top participants in the #AcademicTwitter community were educators, media platforms, and other professionals which centered on conversations related to topics such as accessibility, academic life experiences, and teaching and research support. The study of social media in academic professional settings is still new. Our work contributes to the literature of social networks in academia, helping better understand how users connect and the network that supports the #AcademicTwitter community."
25,Synthesis of Social Media Messages and Tweets as Feedback Medium in Introductory Programming,"Social Media have been recognised as supportive tools in education for creating benefits that supplement students’ collaboration, class interactions, as well as communication between instructors and students. Active informal interaction and feedback between instructors and students outside class belong to the main reasons behind social media pedagogy. Despite the prevalence of traditional email methods of providing feedback to students, the literature shows that they do not check their emails as frequently as they check their social media accounts. In this paper we present the automatic generation of feedback messages and tweets with context-free grammars (CFG). Our system takes a class list of students and their mark sheets and automatically composes Twitter tweets concerning statistical ‘fun facts’ about programming problems, exercises, class performances, as well as private messages about individual student performances. A survey with 116 participating students showed that the majority of them would like to receive such notifications on social media rather than emails. Lecturers found our system promising, too."
26,Researching EMEMUS,"This chapter illustrates the research potential of the ROAD-MAPPING framework as it argues for possibilities of using the framework for investigations into English-medium Education in Multilingual University Settings (EMEMUS). By way of exemplification, two research focal points are foregrounded: participant expectations and evaluations of relevant educational practices, on the one hand, and, on the other, English-medium classroom discourse. For these two investigative areas, four finished studies (Baker & Hüttner in Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development 38(6): 501–516, 2016 ; Dafouz, Hüttner, & Smit in Conceptualising integration in CLIL and multilingual education . Multilingual Matters, Bristol, UK, pp. 123–143, 2016 ; Komori-Glatz in English as a business lingua franca in multicultural student teamwork: An EMEMUS study (PhD thesis). University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, 2017 ; Smit, 2010b ) are introduced that showcase different ways of how the framework has informed the phases of conceptualisation, study design and methodology, data analysis and/or interpretation of findings. By extension, we argue that these examples illustrate that investigations into EMEMUS benefit from working with the ROAD-MAPPING framework."
27,Social Networks in Higher Education Management,
28,Digital Universities in Russia: Prospects and Problems,"The education sector is subject to significant changes due to the increasingly active spread of digital technologies. Usually, the trends in the implementation of digital technologies in educational and research activities are set by commercial organizations – private universities, business schools, corporate universities. But public universities and institutions start to think more and more about digital transformation. By the end of the year, several Russian universities will receive grants for the creation and operation centers of development of digital university models. Anticipating the events, the article considers the model of a digital university, which consists of four blocks – university management information systems, online support for the educational process, key competencies of the digital economy and educational process management based on an individual educational path. The object of the study was the State University of Management and the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation. After examination of the current state of university digitalization, we have identified major problems which become an obstacle during digital transformation."
29,Exploiting Peer Review in Microteaching Through the Ld-Feedback App in Teacher Education,"This paper presents a case study in which student-teachers practiced microteaching in the form of peer-teaching. They collaboratively developed a learning design, implemented it as a micro-lesson i.e. as a simulated teaching session and later they participated in a structured peer review activity. In particular, students initially used the Integrated Learning Design Environment to organize their task and its integrated WebCollage editor for authoring the learning design. Then these particular designs were implemented as a micro-lesson during which the authors of the design “taught” their peers who played the role of the students. After each micro-lesson, the Ld-Feedback application was used so that the student-teachers who practiced the microteaching got feedback from their peers regarding both the design and the implementation. This paper focuses on the first phase of the peer review activity explaining the use of the Ld-Feedback App and investigating the added value of involving student-teachers in creating feedback forms to evaluate their learning designs."
30,Successful Factors for Adoption of Synchronous Tools in Online Teaching at Scale,"With the advancement of technology in recent decades, online learning is becoming increasingly popular."
31,Can We Use Gamification to Predict Students’ Performance? A Case Study Supported by an Online Judge,"The impact of gamification has been typically evaluated via self-report assessments (questionnaires, surveys, etc.). In this work, we analise the use of gamification elements as parameters, to predict whether students are going to fail or not in a programming course. Additionally, unlike prior research, we verify how usage of gamification features can predict student performance not only as a discrete, but as a continuous measure as well , via classification and regression, respectively. Moreover, we apply our approach onto two programming courses from two different universities and involve three gamification features, i.e., ranking , score , and attempts . Our results for both predictions are notable: by using data from only the first quarter of the course, we obtain 89% accuracy for the binary classification task, and explain 78% of the students’ final grade variance, with a mean absolute error of 1.05, for regression. Additionally and interestingly, initial observations point also to gamification elements used in the online judge encouraging competition and collaboration . For the former, students that solved more problems, with fewer attempts, achieved higher scores and ranking. For the latter, students formed groups to generate ideas, then implemented their own solution."
32,Technology of Forming Competence of Pedagogical Design in Graduate and Postgraduate Programs,"The approaches to pedagogical design as an invariant teacher’s activity are analyzed and theoretical and methodological provisions of pedagogical design are highlighted. The content and structure of pedagogical design in the development of educational materials are disclosed. The characteristic of stages of students’ activity in the development of educational materials is presented. The highlighted characteristics of modern teaching materials allow researchers to consider them as an indicator of the quality teacher’s work. The requirements for educational materials are identified and a methodology for assessing their quality is presented. The principles of pedagogical design as a component in the structure of pedagogical activity are formulated. The structure and content of the model for constructing educational materials and methodology for the examination of educational literature have been developed. Experience and implementation of technology development for the formation of competence in pedagogical design of teaching materials in the training of postgraduates and graduate students are analyzed. The technology of teaching the pedagogical design of teaching materials and assessing their quality has been developed and tested, which allows forming a design competence and the competence of an expert assessment of the quality of educational materials."
33,A Framework for Designing and Evaluating Persuasive Technology in Education,"Persuasive technology can influence people to change their behavior. It can be also useful in the education context. For example, it could be integrated with pedagogy for persuading students’ attention in the classroom. Therefore, this research applies the principles of persuasive technology in a university classroom. There are three stages of the proposed framework used in this research. Firstly, the research collected users’ requirements on the persuasive technology in education and list the top 10 most selected persuasive elements. Secondly, the research selected the applications that included elements from the first stage and apply in a classroom for one semester. Furthermore, this study collected data from the student for finding factors affecting the intention to adopt persuasive technology in the classroom. Lastly, the study evaluated users’ performance by comparing the test scores from students who used persuasive technology with the students who did not use it. The results from multiple linear regression showed that primary task support and social support were significantly influencing students’ intention to adopt persuasive technology in the classroom. The classrooms that used persuasive technology have better average scores than the class that did not. Possible future research is also discussed."
34,Exploring the Affordance of Distance Learning Platform (DLP) in COVID19 Remote Learning Environment,"Higher Education has been facing the dilemma of the preferred delivery method for over two decades. COVID19 pandemic in 2020 made the need for further exploration of the same even more imperative. Although the urgency of events did not leave much time for policymakers and educators to decide, it did inspire the authors of this article to analyse the affordances of Distance Learning Platform (DLP), and the ways students perceived the online learning due to current uncertain circumstances. Students as critical stakeholders in the learning process were on the receiving end of the decisions taken to facilitate distance learning. The focus of this study was to understand students’ experience of using the Distance Learning Platform (DLP) in a crises-induced environment at a university in the United Arab Emirates. A sample size of 60 undergraduate students who took academic study skills classes was used to collect data. Students were asked to reflect on their experience of distance learning, and the data were analysed to understand the students’ preferences of their study method while enabling them to recognise their cognitive skillset. The data indicated reasons behind students’ preferences of the preferred delivery method."
35,Cohort Supervision: Towards a Sustainable Model for Distance Learning,"In response to the challenge of increasing supervision capacity while at the same time also improving the supervision experience, we used a design science research approach to guide the design, implementation and evaluation of a cohort supervision model for master’s students in computing at an open-distance university. This paper describes the implementation of a cohort programme in 2018, the findings from data collected during a focus group with students and supervisors, students’ reflective evaluations at the end of the module, feedback from the supervisors, and our reflective notes. Our main theoretical contribution is the cohort model proposed for developing supervision capacity at master’s level. Our practical contribution is a method for a practical supervision model for master’s students based on the concepts of co-operative learning and conversational theory."
36,Künstliche Intelligenz und das deutsche Schulsystem,"Künstliche Intelligenz (KI) ist (noch) kein Thema im deutschen Schulsystem. In diesem Beitrag wird auf die Bedeutung von KI für zentrale Lebensbereiche verwiesen und der Versuch einer aktuellen Standortbestimmung (Ist-Zustand) unternommen. Nach Ableitung eines Zukunftsszenarios für das deutsche Schulsystem (Soll-Zustand) werden abschließend Maßnahmen diskutiert, wie der Soll-Zustand erreicht werden kann. Hierbei wird deutlich, dass das die Berücksichtigung diverser Lernorte (auch über die Schule hinaus) erfordert."
37,Instilling purpose and value in the implementation of digital badges in higher education,"This qualitative multi-case study examined digital badge programs being used at three higher education institutions, at the course level, the department level, and the university level. The study sought to explore the adoption of badges in higher education using Rogers’ ( 2003 ) innovation diffusion theory to identify factors associated with the adoption process in order to provide contextual insight into factors that impede and facilitate successful implementation of badge systems. Rogers established that there are five specific characteristics of innovations (relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability) which are attributed to varying rates of adoption (2003). The results of the current study also attributed factors related to complexity as barriers to successful adoption of badges in each of the three cases. Results found that usability issues, increased faculty workload, and a lack of understanding of the badges’ purpose and value were the main factors which negatively impacted badge adoption."
38,Online teaching in response to student protests and campus shutdowns: academics’ perspectives,"During the period 2015–2017, student protests and university shutdowns rocked the higher education sector in South Africa, with key issues being raised regarding student exclusion based on financial, epistemological and cultural grounds. In this highly politicised and contested environment, some universities decided to use blended and online delivery as a strategy to enable the academic year to be completed and all curriculum to be covered, despite the disruptions. This was a controversial decision politically and a challenging one practically. From the perspective of the academics at the University of Cape Town (UCT), this paper draws on interviews with educators in three broad disciplinary areas to explore their views, practices, and experiences regarding the use of online materials in these unique circumstances. Activity Theory provides a framework to consider the issues systemically and to identify the tensions and contradictions in the system."
39,Perceptions of students after implementing peer instruction in an introductory physics course,"In the present work we carried out a qualitative educational research to assess the perceptions of a group of students that attended (weekly and non-mandatory) complementary classes of a physics course during 2017. In these classes the teaching method called peer instruction (PI) was implemented, which involves collaborative learning among students. From the students’ responses to a simple questionnaire we assessed some basic aspects of these classes from which we can conclude that, in the first place, students considered that PI had positively influenced their comprehension of physical concepts and that, secondly, they positively valued the activities performed and the dynamics of these classes. These results, which are part of a series of previous works that have been published elsewhere, are relevant in a context were active and collaborative learning strategies are practically non-existent and push us to continue and broaden the implementation of this and other active learning methods in physics courses."
40,An intervention engine design and development based on learning analytics: the intelligent intervention system (In^2S),"In this study, an intervention engine based on learning analytics was designed and developed. The intervention engine is named the Intelligent Intervention System (In^2S). Within the scope of this research; In^2S system and its components have been introduced, and the system is evaluated based on learners’ views. In^2S includes three types of intervention that are instructional, supportive, and motivational intervention. The instructional intervention was structured based on assessment tasks. The supportive and motivational interventions were structured based on the learning experiences of the learners. Signal lights (red, yellow, and green) are presented to the learners for each assessment task as an instructional intervention. Supportive intervention is presented to the learners via the dashboard. In the context of motivational intervention, elements of gamification as a leader board, badges, and notifications have been used. In order to obtain the learner’s views about the In^2S, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the learners who had a previous learning experience with the system. The learning environment was evaluated based on their views. Learners had a nine-week learning experience in the e-learning environment. Then, eight students who used the system most actively and eight students who used the system most passively were selected for focus group interviews.. According to the findings, it was seen that the learners who use the intervention engine indicated that the system is useful and want to use it in the context of other courses."
41,Evaluation of awarding badges on Student’s engagement in Gamified e-learning systems,"Gamification has been gaining increasing acceptability in recent times in educational and commercially related activities, as a tool that encourages and improves the motivation of digital native learners. Since learners can easily engage, educationists have explored gamification as a tool for remediation of engagement, motivation, and collaboration. However, the literature showed that the structural and contextual deployment of game elements is defined only partially in practice. Subsequently, gamification success and failure factors should be explored to identify the required enhancement to achieve improved efficiency in current systems. This research extracts the relevant aspects of gamification that need due consideration to make a guided choice through existing theories. This study is based on an online gamified study that uses well-founded concepts in teaching and evaluation of students in a university. Although badges earned and time spent indicated an increase in engagement, the results show that further work needs to be done by incorporating feedback elements, social interaction, and interactive guidance. The underlying impression is that timely, frequent feedback and personalized guidance, avenues for collaboration and interactivity need to be explored towards the better utility of gamification. Therefore, learning culture in the current learner-centered environment should be further studied to infuse better productivity."
42,Analysing gamification elements in educational environments using an existing Gamification taxonomy,"Gamification has been widely employed in the educational domain over the past eight years when the term became a trend. However, the literature states that gamification still lacks formal definitions to support the design and analysis of gamified strategies. This paper analysed the game elements employed in gamified learning environments through a previously proposed and evaluated taxonomy while detailing and expanding this taxonomy. In the current paper, we describe our taxonomy in-depth as well as expand it. Our new structured results demonstrate an extension of the proposed taxonomy which results from this process, is divided into five dimensions, related to the learner and the learning environment. Our main contribution is the detailed taxonomy that can be used to design and evaluate gamification design in learning environments."
43,A Scoping Review of Empirical Research on Recent Computational Thinking Assessments,"Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as an essential twenty-first century competency and it is already embedded in K-12 curricula across the globe. However, research on assessing CT has lagged, with few assessments being implemented and validated. Moreover, there is a lack of systematic grouping of CT assessments. This scoping review examines 39 empirical studies published within the last five years, coded by the specific competencies outlined in existing CT frameworks, to identify and classify the key features of existing CT assessments. Results show that most studies target K-12 settings, focus on interventions that promote CT concepts and practices, adopt a quasi-experimental design, use selected-response items as the dominant testing form, and mainly assess algorithmic thinking, abstraction, problem decomposition, logical thinking, and data. Finally, few CT assessments have been validated in educational settings. Implications include identifying gaps in the CT assessment literature, deepening our understanding of the nature of CT, focusing on the validation of CT assessments, and guiding researchers and practitioners in choosing developmentally appropriate CT assessments. Cognitive and educational implications for future research inquiry include the development of new assessment tools that comprehensively assess CT and its relation to learning."
44,Transformation of a Face-to-Face Workshop into a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC): A Design and Development Case,"The purpose of this design and development case is to share our experiences in the transformation of a face-to-face workshop into a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for a prominent MOOC platform. The goal of the workshop and MOOC is to teach learners how to conduct appropriate power and sample size analysis for multilevel and longitudinal studies in social and behavioral health research. Learners include people from across the biomedical research spectrum, from students to full professors. We first describe the design and development frameworks and processes used to create the three-day, face-to-face workshop. Then, we detail the design and development approach to transform this face-to-face workshop into a MOOC. At a macro-design level, we employed backward design (Wiggins & McTighe 1998 ) as an instructional design framework. At a micro-design level, we used a combination of the first principles of instruction, the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, the nine events of instruction, and design recommendations for MOOCs found in the literature. We report the results of a formative evaluation of the MOOC. Finally, we provide closing remarks, lessons learned, and the next steps for the instructional program."
45,"Effectiveness of flipped classroom combined with team-, case-, lecture- and evidence-based learning on ophthalmology teaching for eight-year program students","Background This study aimed to investigate the benefits and challenges of the flipped classroom combined with team-, case-, lecture- and evidence-based learning (FC-TCLEBL) for ophthalmology teaching for eight-year program students. Methods FC-TCLEBL and the traditional lecture-based classroom (LBC) were compared based on student and teacher feedback questionnaires, student learning burden, and scores on standardized tests as well as their effects on the abilities of clinical thinking, scientific research, active-learning, practical application, humanistic care and communication with patients. Results Both the students and teachers were more satisfied with the FC-TCLEBL model. More students in the FC-TCLEBL group agreed that the course helped them to develop skills in creative thinking, problem solving, and teamwork. Students in the FC-TCLEBL group spent significantly more time preparing for class than those in the LBC group, but the time spent on review was significantly lower in the FC-TCLEBL group. The students from the FC-TCLEBL group performed better in a post-test on diabetic retinopathy (DR) as compared to the LBC group. Conclusions FC-TCLEBL teaching model is effective and suitable for ophthalmology teaching."

47,An empirical study of the effect that a computer graphics course has on visual-spatial abilities,"Visual-spatial abilities are relevant for performing diverse everyday tasks as well as being successful in multiple fields. This work provides empirical evidence supporting the claim that studying a computer graphics course, as commonly offered in computer science or engineering programs, can help develop stronger visual-spatial abilities. This benefit was estimated with the assessment of students’ performances in a standardized test of visual-spatial abilities. This empirical pre-test/post-test study ran for three consecutive semesters and involved six computer graphics groups where students were evaluated with the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test to measure whether the full-semester working on contents heavily related to 2D/3D geometric transformations had a positive effect on students’ visual-spatial intelligence. Results show a statistically significant increase in the average score in the test, which in turn suggests that these cognitive abilities could be reinforced or trained through the normal course workload. Additional findings in this study suggest that a retest gaining factor is present just by taking the test twice, and that there is a weak correlation between students’ level of visual-spatial abilities at the beginning of the course and the final grades obtained at the end of the semester."
48,Using learning analytics to develop early-warning system for at-risk students,"In the current study interaction data of students in an online learning setting was used to research whether the academic performance of students at the end of term could be predicted in the earlier weeks. The study was carried out with 76 second-year university students registered in a Computer Hardware course. The study aimed to answer two principle questions: which algorithms and features best predict the end of term academic performance of students by comparing different classification algorithms and pre-processing techniques and whether or not academic performance can be predicted in the earlier weeks using these features and the selected algorithm. The results of the study indicated that the kNN algorithm accurately predicted unsuccessful students at the end of term with a rate of 89%. When findings were examined regarding the analysis of data obtained in weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and 14 to predict whether the end-of-term academic performance of students could be predicted in the earlier weeks, it was observed that students who were unsuccessful at the end of term could be predicted with a rate of 74% in as short as 3 weeks’ time. The findings obtained from this study are important for the determination of features for early warning systems that can be developed for online learning systems and as indicators of student success. At the same time, it will aid researchers in the selection of algorithms and pre-processing techniques in the analysis of educational data."
49,Assessing peer review pattern and the effect of face-to-face and mobile-mediated modes on students’ academic writing development,"This study examines the distribution of peer review in face-to-face and mobile-mediated peer review groups and their effects on students’ revision skills and academic writing development. Seventy-two first-year English for academic purposes (EAP) students participated in an 18-session IELTS academic writing course in a Canadian university the mobile-mediated peer review group (MMPR) used Telegram to exchange peer comments synchronously, while the face-to-face peer review group (FFPR) did peer review in the classroom. An adapted analytic scheme ( Journal of English for Academic Purposes , 2, 193–227, 2003) and the IELTS academic writing assessment criteria were used to conceptualize the peer comments in terms of frequency, area, type, nature, and IELTS assessment categories. Results indicated that the total number of comments, the percentage of revision-oriented comments and actual revisions made by the MMPR group were statistically more significant than those by the FFPR group. Furthermore, the MMPR group made more local revision-oriented comments than that of FFPR. However, the revision-oriented suggestion in local areas was the most distributed type of comment made by both groups. Regarding the IELTS assessment criteria, the FFPR group made more comments on task achievement and coherence and cohesion, whereas the comments made by the MMPR group targeted more lexical resources, and grammatical range and accuracy. In addition, the results showed that both MMPR and FFPR groups developed their IELTS academic writing skills while the MMPR mode of collaboration outperformed the FFPR."
50,Systematic review of research on artificial intelligence applications in higher education – where are the educators?,"According to various international reports, Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) is one of the currently emerging fields in educational technology. Whilst it has been around for about 30 years, it is still unclear for educators how to make pedagogical advantage of it on a broader scale, and how it can actually impact meaningfully on teaching and learning in higher education. This paper seeks to provide an overview of research on AI applications in higher education through a systematic review. Out of 2656 initially identified publications for the period between 2007 and 2018, 146 articles were included for final synthesis, according to explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The descriptive results show that most of the disciplines involved in AIEd papers come from Computer Science and STEM, and that quantitative methods were the most frequently used in empirical studies. The synthesis of results presents four areas of AIEd applications in academic support services, and institutional and administrative services: 1. profiling and prediction, 2. assessment and evaluation, 3. adaptive systems and personalisation, and 4. intelligent tutoring systems. The conclusions reflect on the almost lack of critical reflection of challenges and risks of AIEd, the weak connection to theoretical pedagogical perspectives, and the need for further exploration of ethical and educational approaches in the application of AIEd in higher education."
51,Students’ perceptions of a food safety and quality e-learning course: a CASE study for a MSC in food consumption,"Life long training and education in food safety is a crucial issue in particular for professionals working in the field. At the same time there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of that training in particular when is given in e-learning. The purpose of this explorative work is to evaluate the Food Safety and Quality e-learning course within a Master program offered in the National Distance Learning University in Portugal. Following a case study methodology a mixed methods approached was used, based on an online questionnaire survey to students that enrolled the course, followed by a Focus Group Discussion to better discuss the weak points addressed by the students in the questionnaire. The questionnaire aimed to assess students perceptions about the course organization, recourses, assignments, acquired competences, change attitudes and behaviour and link with the professional activity Students who enrolled the course during 2016/17 and 2017/18 were surveyed in the fourth semester of the curricular year, in the period of development of the master thesis dissertation. In addition a quantitative analysis was conducted in the temporal distributions of messages published on the Moodle platform (learning analytics) to evaluate students’ interactions and engagement during the course. This study has shown that overall, students are very satisfied with the course, however they suggested improvements that are needed considering the pedagogical model used and their availability to learn as students with full time jobs, most related with the food science. This explorative research aimed to contribute to the improvement of food safety and quality training based also on recent tools and recommendations within e-learning in science education."
52,"Online module login data as a proxy measure of student engagement: the case of myUnisa, Moya^MA, Flipgrid, and Gephi at an ODeL institution in South Africa","The current study employed online module login data harvested from three tools, my Unisa, Moya^MA and Flipgrid to determine how such data served as a proxy measure of student engagement. The first tool is a legacy learning management system (LMS) utilised for online learning at the University of South Africa (UNISA), while the other two tools are a mobile messaging application and an educational video discussion platform, respectively. In this regard, the study set out to investigate the manner in which module login data of undergraduate students ( n  = 3475 & n  = 2954) and a cohort of Mathew Goniwe students ( n  = 27) enrolled for a second-level module, ENG2601, as extracted from my Unisa, Moya^MA, and Flipgrid served as a proxy measure of student engagement. Collectively, these students were registered for this second-level module at UNISA at the time the study was conducted. The online login data comprised my Unisa module login file access frequencies. In addition, the online login data consisted of the frequencies of instant messages (IMs) posted on Moya^MA by both the facilitator and Mathew Goniwe students, and video clips posted on and video clip view frequencies captured by Flipgrid in respect of the afore-cited module. One finding of this study is that student engagement as measured by login file access frequencies was disproportionally skewed toward one module file relative to other module files. The other finding of this study is that the overall module file access metrics of the Mathew Goniwe group were disproportionally concentrated in a sub-cohort of highly active users (HAU)."
53,A review of empirical studies of affordances and development of a framework for educational adoption of mobile social media,"As one of the most widely adopted mobile and social media applications, Tencent WeChat ^® (‘WeChat’) has been increasingly used in education at all levels in Asia, and in China in particular. However, only a small number of studies have been conducted to explore educational affordances of WeChat. In this paper, these affordances are defined as opportunities for an educational activity that are determined and supported by perceived and actual features of a technology tool or an environment (Gibson in The ecological approach to visual perception, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1979; Norman in The psychology of everyday things, Basic Books, New York, 1988; Sanders in Ecol Psychol 9(1):97–112, 1997). The authors conducted a review of 21 studies out of a pool of 1984 identified publications on the topic to examine existing practices, empirical studies and recommendations for the uses of WeChat, and with the over-reaching aim of articulating a framework for the adoption of educational affordances of mobile social media. Such framework will serve practice as well as research on educational uses of mobile social media and help extend theory of affordances in this domain. A total of seven categories of educational affordances of WeChat were explicated and included in this framework: Resources Sharing, Authentic Learning, Collaboration, Community Building, Motivating Environment, Evaluation and Feedback, and Administration for Learning. Guidelines for the adoption of this framework are developed, and suggestions for future research are proposed."
54,Use of Twitter across educational settings: a review of the literature,"The use of social media across the educational landscape is on the rise. Subsequently, the body of research on this topic is vibrant and growing. In this article, we present findings from a review of 103 peer-reviewed scientific studies published over the last decade (2007–2017) that address the use of Twitter for educational purposes across formal and informal settings. The majority of the studies reported in the literature are descriptive case studies carried out with students in North American and European higher education settings. Analysis of these studies signals Twitter as a useful tool for communication due to high accessibility, novelty, and real-time format. Students, teachers, and other stakeholders use it as a pedagogical tool to gain information, interact and engage with each other, participate in their respective communities of interests, and share their insights about specific topics. Moreover, Twitter has the potential to enhance students’ learning capabilities as well as improve their motivation and engagement due to its unique features and non-traditional teaching approach. Finally, our analysis advocates for carrying out further empirical studies focusing on digital trace data and inference, particularly in the developing countries."
55,The relation between task-unrelated media multitasking and task-related motivation,"In two experiments, we explored the relation between participants’ (a) levels of motivation to complete a task and (b) task-unrelated media multitasking. In Experiment 1, we examined the extent to which participants’ levels of motivation to complete a task influenced their tendency to engage in task-unrelated media multitasking. Participants completed a 1-back task, while having the opportunity to turn on and off an unrelated, optional video. Results showed that participants who were told they would finish the experiment early if they achieved a sufficient level of performance (the motivated group) were significantly less likely to play the optional video during the 1-back task than those who were not given the opportunity to finish early (control condition). In Experiment 2, we examined the extent to which engaging in task-unrelated media multitasking affected task-related motivation. Three groups of participants completed a 1-back task, while (a) no video was presented, (b) a video was continuously played, or (c) participants could turn on and off a video at their leisure (as in Experiment 1). At both the beginning and the end of Experiment 2, participants were asked to indicate their level of motivation to complete the task. Interestingly, results revealed that continuously having the video playing helped sustain task-related motivation. Thus, although greater motivation to perform a task reduces the likelihood of engaging in task-unrelated media multitasking, such media multitasking also appears to increase levels of motivation."
56,Using scaffold innovation-thinking frameworks to integrate food science and technology into the transdisciplinary engineering design classroom,"Technology and innovation are essential for students to not only learn and understand the technical skills, but also identify a problem, discover a solution, and communicate the value proposition. In this study, innovation-thinking frameworks were integrated into undergraduate transdisciplinary engineering and technology classrooms with a topic of food science and technology, exploring design within the area of new product development. The qualitative analysis, conducted using NVivo, indicated that the food science and technology focused educational experiences had the potential of transforming student self-reported perspectives related to metacognitive reflection, connecting the topics to the real-world and communicating. The findings offer exciting insights into the benefit of integrating self-regulated learning, visualization, and communication technology into future food-related education programs."
57,The effectiveness of an online learning system based on aptitude scores: An effort to improve students’ brain activation,"The differences in learning preferences can be attributed to the differences in individuals’ cognitive capacities which may lead them to undertake a certain behavior. It is argued that characterizing the learning complexity based on the volume of information presented to learners can eliminate any avoidable load on working memory. This study examined the effectiveness of an online continuous adaptive mechanism (OCAM) based on changes in learner aptitude scores across learning sessions. The representation of the learning content in these sessions was designed for a low-, medium-, and high-aptitude individual. The brain activation of 12 students (6 male and 4 female; aged 20–25 years), obtained from using the proposed system, was examined using an electroencephalogram (EEG). The result showed that OCAM helped learners to understand the content being presented according to their aptitude scores, thus improving their brain activation. Findings from this study can be used to inform online system designers and developers about the importance of incorporating aptitude scores for customizing the representation of learning materials in an online environment."
58,M-learning adoption in the Arab gulf countries: A systematic review of factors and challenges,"The simplicity and minimal cost of mobile phones make them more suitable for use among students and educators across the world. The integration of mobile technology in a university context has been found to provide a superior learning environment compared to the traditional classroom lecture. Yet, there are several challenges that may delay the adoption of m-learning and postpone the revolution it promised. Arab Gulf Countries (AGC), like other developing countries, are encountering challenges linked to the acceptance and adoption of m-learning. Therefore, it is vital to examine the factors driving the adoption of m-learning among instructors and students in these countries. This paper identified the influential factors affecting m-learning adoption among students in Arab Gulf universities. The challenges of adopting m-learning were also identified. A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the current evidence on the use of m-learning in AGC. The results showed different factors (mostly cultural and social) that contribute to m-learning acceptance/adoption in Arab Gulf universities. Findings from this study can aid educational policy makers with planning and implementing effective m-learning programs."
59,Comparison of video demonstrations and bedside tutorials for teaching paediatric clinical skills to large groups of medical students in resource-constrained settings,"Videos are increasingly being used for teaching clinical skills in medical education. However, most reports on the effectiveness and benefits of videos in medical teaching have come from developed countries. Resource constraints in South African academic hospitals, together with increasing numbers, may apply pressure on the standard of clinical teaching. This study investigated the potential for using video demonstrations to replace the bedside teaching of introductory paediatric clinical examination skills to large groups of medical students. Sixty medical students were randomised to an experimental group that watched a video of a paediatric abdominal examination or to a control group that received a bedside tutorial on the same topic. Immediately afterwards, experienced assessors observed and scored the students in a clinical examination. Data were analysed for the non-inferiority of the video group scores within a 10% margin of the bedside group. Students’ and clinician educators’ perceptions of the two teaching methods and their views on how video instruction could be integrated into the clinical teaching programme were explored. Qualitative data were analysed thematically. The video teaching was non-inferior to the bedside teaching within the 10% margin and did not significantly affect the pass/fail or distinction rates. Students and clinician educators suggested that the videos be used for teaching basic concepts, allowing bedside tutorials to focus on applied learning. The findings have important implications for using video demonstrations to supplement the teaching of clinical skills to large groups of medical students across multiple variably-resourced settings."
60,Learners’ beliefs about language-learning abilities in face-to-face & online settings,"This mixed-methods study investigates the beliefs of language learners about their ability to attend language classes and learn the language in face-to-face and online settings using Ajzen’s perceived behavioral control (PBC) construct. Two treatments were conducted in two contexts: a face-to-face language-learning context ( n  = 684) and an online language-learning context ( n  = 289 ) . The results show that certain variable beliefs can predict students’ PBC\self-efficacy in both contexts. The comparative results in both contexts show that students have more positive PBC beliefs toward learning a language in face-to-face settings than in online settings. Based on the results, the use of mixed-methods research is recommended for investigating language learners’ beliefs. The use of Ajzen’s PBC concept confirms the need to employ different theoretical models in eliciting and examining the ability of language learners to learn the language, as well as the importance of avoiding overused theoretical models to enhance the understanding of the language-learning process."
61,"A Systematic Approach to Designing, Implementing, and Evaluating Learner-Generated Digital Media (LGDM) Assignments and Its Effect on Self-regulation in Tertiary Science Education","This study explored the self-regulation strategies and learning experiences of undergraduate science students completing Learner-Generated Digital Media (LGDM) assignments that had been implemented using a theory-driven, systematic approach. The rationale for using LGDM in science education is to facilitate student learning of complex scientific concepts through the multimodal representation of content using digital media. The study was conducted in seven science subjects from first to third year in Autumn 2017, using a sample of 348 undergraduate science students attending a university located in Sydney, Australia. All the participants were enrolled in subjects that required them to communicate complex scientific concepts using digital media. Training on LGDM was conducted online ( n  = 199) and in blended mode ( n  = 149). The study used a mixed-methods approach with a validated self-regulation questionnaire, LMS logs, assessment scores, group contribution data, open-ended questions, and interviews. Online students were more likely than blended students to report using self-regulation strategies for goal setting, time management, task strategies, and help-seeking. Data triangulation revealed that participation in LGDM assignments was perceived by students to contribute to their science content knowledge, provide them with digital media skills, and nurture their capacity for working in groups. The findings of this study have implications for how LGDM is deployed in science education."
62,"MOOC-based flipped learning in higher education: students’ participation, experience and learning performance","Relying on advanced network technologies, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) can support the transformation and deep construction of high-quality open courses. However, with the use of MOOCs in many universities and colleges, new issues have emerged. MOOCs are not specifically designed for local conditions. Researchers lack understanding of the effectiveness of using shared MOOCs in traditional university teaching. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of MOOC-based flipped learning and to propose clear reuse guidelines for MOOCs in the traditional university education. We conducted a quasi-experiment in an inorganic chemistry course. The results were presented in terms of learners’ participation and learning performance, and a post-task survey and interviews were also conducted to investigate the students’ experiences in order to include these experiences in design and research plans of MOOCs-based flipped learning. The results showed that students in the MOOC-based flipped classroom on average performed better than those in the traditional classroom. However, no changes in self-efficacy and self-regulated learning were detected after the end of the course. In addition, the quantitative and qualitative data combined indicated that most students had a favorable experience of the flipped classroom, in terms of student–student interaction, available learning materials, and active learning results. Implications for MOOC integration are discussed."
63,Augmented reality system for tourism using image-based recognition,"This study aimed to explore the design and production of mobile device-based materials for cultural heritage tourism and tourist learning outcomes. A mobile application was adopted to help volunteer tour guides-in-training and visitors better understand the connotations and knowledge associated with the culture of Dalongdong, Taipei, Taiwan. Participants in this study were divided into control and experimental groups to examine their learning outcomes in terms of their cultural and historical knowledge before and after embarking on the tour. A correlation analysis was conducted that guided tours assisted by digital technologies lead to more significant learning outcomes than narrative and interpretive tours delivered by guides alone. According to the experimental results, the experimental group, whose tour experience was facilitated by the mobile application developed in this study, exhibited significant differences and improvement in learning outcomes compared with the control group, whose tour was conducted solely through traditional oral narratives. This study’s practical contribution to the development of the cultural tourism industry includes the promotion of humanistic and artistic exchanges between urban and rural areas and the encouragement of young people to engage in cultural appreciation events and identify their interests in cultural and artistic activities."
64,Online communication and interaction in distance higher education: A framework study of good practice,"Communication et interaction en ligne dans l’enseignement supérieur à distance : une étude cadre des bonnes pratiques – L’enseignement à distance nécessite une forme de conception pédagogique susceptible d’induire une transformation de l’enseignement. Elle est marquée par une grande flexibilité, l’autonomie de l’apprenant et un vaste recours aux technologies numériques qui améliorent les résultats d’apprentissage. La caractéristique principale de ce type de méthodologie réside dans la distance physique entre enseignants, pairs et institutions éducatives. Divers outils technologiques sont utilisés pour réduire cette distance et améliorer la communication et l’interaction. Les auteurs de cet article tentent un recensement de la documentation dans le domaine en vue d’en dégager les stratégies permettant d’améliorer la communication et l’interaction en ligne dans les environnements virtuels d’apprentissage. Après une analyse du cadre théorique pour la communication et l’interaction en ligne, ils présentent les facteurs contribuant à la création de cours et de programmes en ligne bien structurés, interactifs et dynamiques destinés aux étudiants. Ils explorent les aspects multidimensionnels de la communication dans les environnements virtuels d’apprentissage ainsi que les formes diverses d’interaction. Enfin, ils s’aident de méthodes qualitatives pour concevoir un cadre censé aider tuteurs et concepteurs pédagogiques à élaborer des cours d’enseignement supérieur en ligne plus efficaces. Cet article peut également être utile aux chercheurs et praticiens spécialistes intéressés par les question de communication, aux concepteurs de formations en ligne et aux gestionnaires des établissements recrutant des enseignants pour les cours en ligne. Distance education requires an instructional design approach that can lead to educational transformation. This is characterised by advanced flexibility, learner autonomy and extensive use of digital technologies to enhance learning outcomes. The main feature of such methodology is the physical distance between teaching staff, peers and educational institutions. Various technological tools are used to bridge this distance and improve communication and interaction. This article attempts to review the literature in the field, with the aim of highlighting strategies for enhancing communication and interaction in online learning environments. After discussing the theoretical framework for online communication and interaction, the authors outline the factors involved in creating well-structured, interactive and dynamic online courses and programmes for higher education students. The article explores the multi-dimensional aspects of communication in online learning environments and the differing forms of interaction involved. Using qualitative methods, the authors’ aim is to produce a framework to help tutors and instructional designers develop more effective online courses in higher education. In addition, this article may be of value to researchers and scholar-practitioners interested in communication issues, to online learning designers, and to institutional managers recruiting teaching staff for online educational courses."
65,Blogging as a tool for the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge in health sciences: a preliminary evaluation,"Tools for online collaboration are becoming increasingly prevalent in recent years. Certain characteristics of these tools encourage this proliferation: they are easy to use, always available, allow knowledge to be built collaboratively and disseminated quickly through social networks, and are usually free of charge. In this context, blogs are becoming increasingly important in the field of health as digital newspapers and magazines that support a large number of multimedia formats. The possibility to subscribe to blogs and their availability in formats adaptable to mobile devices mean their content can be taken anywhere. Although the use of blogs is well-established among Health Science professionals, their use among university professors as a component of the teaching strategies in these disciplines is much less common, and thus the benefits, risks and limitations of using blogging as a pedagogical tool are poorly understood. In this preliminary evaluation of a pedagogy, a public WordPress-based blog was developed for the Nutrition and Dietetics module of the undergraduate course in Nursing at the University of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). This was primarily intended as way to use ICT to increase the level of student engagement and interest in learning the subject, but also as a way to introduce future health professionals to the world of blogging. This paper describes our experiences with this pedagogical project and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the use of blogs in university Health Sciences teaching. Incorporating this tool into teaching methodologies takes advantages of the theoretical possibilities it offers, which include crucial aspects such as developing critical thinking, acquiring knowledge, answering questions from students, and enabling new mechanisms to develop the skills that must be acquired. However, the challenges and inconveniences are also highlighted; these are principally the lack of motivation and the low participation of the students. By analysing the outcomes of this preliminary evaluation of a pedagogy, it is concluded that blogs are a very useful tool, although it is suggested that the literature shows a certain bias toward the publication of successful trials."
66,Optimising Moodle quizzes for online assessments,"Background Computer-aided learning management systems (LMSs) are widely used in higher education and are viewed as beneficial when transitioning from conventional face-to-face teaching to fully online courses. While LMSs have unique tools for transferring and assessing knowledge, their ability to engage and assess learners needs further investigation. This paper focuses on a study examining the LMS “Moodle” to ascertain the effectiveness of “Moodle quizzes” to improve, assess and distinguish knowledge in a civil engineering course at an Australian university. The course has a database comprising 62 formative and 61 summative quiz questions with embedded text, images, audio and video. This study investigates the use of these quiz questions with four course cohorts and 169 students. The quizzes assessed competencies of students during various stages of a study period through automated marking. The suitability of questions to assess and distinguish student knowledge levels was determined using a psychometric analysis based on facility index (FI) and the discrimination index (DI) statistics embedded within the Moodle quizzes. Results This study highlights strategies used to set and review quiz questions for formative and summative assessments. Results indicated that students were engaged and satisfied in the formative assessment because they viewed the interactive videos between 2 and 6 times and 65% of students attempted all the formative questions. The FI indicated student pass rate for the summative questions and DI indicated the difficulty of these questions, while the combination of FI and DI results separated students with different knowledge levels. Using these Moodle statistics provided information to make effective decisions on how to improve the summative quizzes. Conclusion The multimodal quizzes were effective in teaching and assessing a theoretical engineering course and provided efficient methods to replace conventional assessments. The FI and DI indexes are useful statistical tools in redesigning appropriate sets of questions. Time-poor academics will benefit from using these easily attainable Moodle statistics to inform decisions while revising the quizzes and making assessments more autonomous."
67,Prediction of Student’s performance by modelling small dataset size,"Prediction of student’s performance became an urgent desire in most of educational entities and institutes. That is essential in order to help at-risk students and assure their retention, providing the excellent learning resources and experience, and improving the university’s ranking and reputation. However, that might be difficult to be achieved for startup to mid-sized universities, especially those which are specialized in graduate and post graduate programs, and have small students’ records for analysis. So, the main aim of this project is to prove the possibility of training and modeling a small dataset size and the feasibility of creating a prediction model with credible accuracy rate. This research explores as well the possibility of identifying the key indicators in the small dataset, which will be utilized in creating the prediction model, using visualization and clustering algorithms. Best indicators were fed into multiple machine learning algorithms to evaluate them for the most accurate model. Among the selected algorithms, the results proved the ability of clustering algorithm in identifying key indicators in small datasets. The main outcomes of this study have proved the efficiency of support vector machine and learning discriminant analysis algorithms in training small dataset size and in producing an acceptable classification’s accuracy and reliability test rates."
68,Modelling an interplay of adoption determinants with respect to social Web applications used in massive online open courses,"One of the major problems of using massive online open courses (MOOCs) commonly reported in the literature is the high dropout rate of students. Active participation in creating, sharing and managing content, simultaneous work on the same artefact, synchronous and asynchronous interaction and variety of functionalities that stimulate productivity in performing assignments are some of the benefits of employing social Web applications in MOOCs that have the potential to boost students’ motivation, thus addressing the aforementioned issue. Successful implementation of social Web applications in MOOCs is largely influenced by their acceptance by students. The aim of this paper is to examine the psychometric characteristics of the research framework which reflects the interplay of adoption determinants with respect to two representatives of social Web applications meant for collaborative work. An empirical study was conducted in which students of one Croatian higher education institution served as representative sample of users. Data were collected by means of the post-use questionnaire. The validity and reliability of the proposed research framework and associated hypotheses were examined by means of the partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modelling (SEM) technique. Implications for both researchers and practitioners are presented and discussed."
69,Teaching technology with technology: approaches to bridging learning and teaching gaps in simulation-based programming education,"The learning of programming using simulation involves unique educational environments and human factors. However, research in this field has been mainly centred on the efficacy of the simulation tool whereas there is a lack of comparative studies between the associated teaching and learning procedures. To address the gap, this study facilitates an evidence-driven discussion on learning and teaching, as well as their relationship, in simulation-based programming education. Investigation areas include virtual and physical environments of simulation sessions, relevant learning enablers and impediments, and roles of students and faculty members in the process. The study followed qualitative methodology using focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Thirty-seven students and four lecturers on a computing course at a British university shared experiences and perceptions on simulation-based programming sessions. The data were analysed thematically and through cross-evaluation. The findings have provided fresh insights on several enabling and challenging aspects of simulation-based programming education. On the one hand, visualisation, consistency of learning procedures, and student engagement emerged as empowering factors. On the other, the negative implications of collaborative tasks, students’ attention diversion while shifting between virtual and physical environments of learning, and lecturers’ over-emphasis on technology in teaching preparation, appeared as challenges. The paper contributes to understanding the advantages and challenges of using simulation in programming education. It suggests essential teaching principles and their application procedures, which add value to the overall computing education at tertiary level. The learning is transferrable among other engineering programmes and academic disciplines that use simulation for educational purposes."
70,The influence of general self-efficacy on the interpretation of vicarious experience information within online learning,"An individual’s general self-efficacy affects their cognitive behaviours in a number of ways. Previous research has found general self-efficacy to influence how people interpret persuasive messages designed to encourage behavioural change. No previous work has looked into how general self-efficacy affects the interpretation of vicarious experience information and how this affects self-efficacy in being able to complete a set task within a career skills online learning environment. The study presented considers this gap in knowledge, analysing the effect of six different types of vicarious experience information on the self-efficacy of online workshop participants to complete a set task. In analysing the results, each participant’s general self-efficacy was considered. Results showed individuals with low general self-efficacy to find vicarious experience information significantly less beneficial for their self-efficacy in completing a set task when compared to others with high general self-efficacy. Those with low general self-efficacy were more likely to make negative self-comparisons to the vicarious experience information, restricting its potential to increase their self-efficacy. In contrast, participants with high general self-efficacy found many of the vicarious experience information presented to be beneficial to their self-efficacy to complete the set task as they were more likely to dismiss any information they interpreted to be negative. Results from this study highlight the importance of more research into how vicarious experience information can be designed and presented in a way that ensures benefit to the task-specific self-efficacy of all individuals, regardless of their general self-efficacy beliefs at the time."
71,Structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis of social media use and education,"The objective of this study is to design a structural equation model and test confirmatory factor analysis system in order to better explain how students could utilize social networking system (Facebook) for educational purposes. Thus, this paper seeks to examine the attitude, perception and behaviour of Japanese students’ towards social-networking sites, and how students from non-English speaking backgrounds (especially Japanese students) at the University of Toyama perceive the use of Facebook for learning English as a foreign language. Our Structural Equation Modelling system based Facebook model outline the relations among different types of independent, dependent variables and constructs. We tested our model using adequate fitting indices like Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Non-Normed Fit Index/Tucker Lewis index (NNFI/TLI) and Incremental Fit Index (IFI). The results of the proposed model confirmed the hypothesized latent structures and theoretical validity of probed factors. Conclusions drawn from this study might be useful to better understand the use of social networking tools in educational context."
72,Using Hypervideo to support undergraduate students’ reflection on work practices: a qualitative study,"According to several exploratory studies, the HyperVideo seems to be particularly useful in highlighting the existing connections between the school-based and the work-based contexts, between authentic work situations and theoretical underpinnings. This tool and its features, in particular, the video annotation, seems to constitute an instrument which facilitates the students’ reflection on work-practices. Even though several researchers have already studied the efficacy of HyperVideo, studies concerning the qualitative differences between a reflection process activated with or without its use are still missing. Therefore, the present contribution is focused on the reflective processes activated by two groups of students engaged in a higher education course while they carry out a reflective activity on work practices using the HyperVideo or not. The aim is to investigate wether the HyperVideo can be useful for students to foster the connection between theoretical concepts and work practices. Through multi-step qualitative analysis which combined Thematic Qualitative Text Analysis and Grounded Theory, a sample of reflective reports drafted by a group of students who employed HiperVideo to make a video-interview on a work-practice and to reflect on it (Group A) was compared with a sample of reflective reports drafted by a group who did not use it to complete the same task (Group B). The results emerging from the comparison of the coding frequencies between the two groups show that HyperVideo can support the reflective processes of students, better connecting theory and professional practice."
73,Engaging children with educational content via Gamification,"Gamification is the application of game mechanisms in non-gaming environments with the objective of enhancing user experience. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of gamification in educational context, i.e. teaching numeracy at a primary school level. We study the appealing characteristics of engaging computer games from children’s point of view, and investigate whether embedding the proposed characteristics into an educational tool enhances children’s learning. The main characteristics we identify are levels of difficulties, feedback from the current level, and graphical presentation. They were then embedded into a Java-based open source programme based on “ Who wants to be a millionaire ” TV show, with the aim of teaching children numeracy (level 5 New Zealand curriculum). Two versions were created: feature enriched game ( FEG ) with all the features enabled and feature devoid game ( FDG) with no extra features. We present the results of an evaluation study done with primary school children ( n  =  120 ) over a period of two weeks. The effectiveness of the educational tool was measured using a pre-test and a post-test, as well as other indicators such as the frequency and duration of interaction. Results show that the FEG version was more effective in enhancing children’s learning and they found it more engaging."
74,Understanding openness through (in)visible platform boundaries: a topological study on MOOCs as multiplexes of spaces and times,"Among new technologies in education, the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is one of the phenomena that received much attention. However, controversy developed around the meaning of the word ‘open’ as integrated in the acronym. Despite the disagreements, studies on MOOCs generally do not formulate clear conceptual or operational descriptions of what openness implies for their research. Without explicating these descriptions, it becomes impossible for HE practitioners and researchers to gain a sense of how the proclaimed open nature of MOOCs is and can be realized in practice. This study aims to respond to this debate and the prevailing ambiguity and confusion around the concept ‘openness’ by examining the relevance of an alternative view. That is, through the lens of social topology, this study considers how openness is enacted in multiple forms that interact. The study further examines whether and how openness is performed through the specific way in which boundaries operate. Based on an empirical case study on a MOOC platform developed and administered by several European universities, the study presents a combination of descriptions, sketches and legends that describe multiple spaces and times of openness in the MOOC platform. The study therewith provides strong arguments for the pertinence of this alternative view, and invites further research on higher education initiatives to examine the various yet specific ways openness can be established."
75,Student views on the use of flipped learning in higher education: A pilot study,"Flipped learning becomes increasingly popular in higher education with the widespread use of the Internet. The traditional methods are deeply teacher-centered and students usually listen to the teacher during the course. This is different in flipped learning and the time spent in the classroom involves rich learning activities. It allowed learners to take a more active role in the class than the traditional methods. However, flipped learning also has many challenges for students. The purpose of this study is to determine the benefits and challenges of flipped learning in higher education. Participants’ views of flipped learning were collected through a questionnaire with open-ended questions. The results indicated that implementing flipped learning gave students a chance to experience greater instructional flexibility during both online and in-class sessions. The students said that they felt more responsible for their own learning. And some of them expressed disappointment with the lack of immediate feedback while watching videos and with their poor Internet accessibility outside of the classroom."
76,A comparison of students’ twitter use in a postsecondary course delivered on campus and online,"Social media’s reach has extended into our personal, professional, and educational lives. Related to the latter, research has examined how technologies, such as Twitter, can be used as communication and evaluation tools in postsecondary settings. No known studies have considered students’ experiences using Twitter in different course delivery formats (e.g., on campus compared to online courses), yet this can inform instructor decision-making on whether Twitter can be more effectively incorporated as an instructional tool in one format over another. This study sets out to examine whether differences existed between students’ perceptions and use of this social media platform as a device for learning and “classroom” connectedness. As students’ perceptions can reveal the effectiveness of pedagogical strategies given their position at the center of the learning process, the present study relied on anonymous, voluntary online survey results from 37 students enrolled in an upper-level Sociology of Deviance course delivered by the same instructor both online and on campus to ascertain students’ use of Twitter and their perceptions of using Twitter in learning, as a course evaluation tool, and in connecting students. Our findings suggest there are interesting differences in the social networking platform’s use between the two course formats. These differences were used to recommend strategies for how instructors can integrate Twitter into their courses, both online and on campus."
77,Drivers to adopting B-flow ultrasonography:contextualizing the integrated technology acceptance model,"Background Ovarian torsion is an unprecedented gynecological crisis that regularly influences ladies of regenerative age. Its signs and indications are like those of other abdominal conditions, which make its differential determination testing. B-flow ultrasonography (B-flow USG), which is utilized for the differential determination of ovarian torsion, is the highest quality level non-intrusive indicative instrument in the early period of an ovarian torsion. The aim of this paper is to investigate and incorporate variety of factors affecting physicians’ actual use of B-flow USG. Methods Drawing from technology acceptance model (TAM), five variables – actual use, behavioral intention to use, attitude toward use, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness – are integrated with social influence and knowledge to propose a theoretical model. The data was collected from the medical doctors including radiologists, urologists, gynecologists, pediatric surgeons between June and October 2018. The sample size is N  = 512 hence, structural equation modeling (SEM) methodology has been implemented to study the relationship between explanatory factors and actual use of B-flow USG. SmartPLS 3.2.7 software was used for the data analysis and testing of the validity of the eight hypotheses. Results The results indicate that actual use of B-flow USG is positively affected by knowledge, social influence, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward use and behavioral intention to use. Conclusions It is discovered that perceived usefulness mediates the relationship between perceived ease of use and attitude toward use, and attitude toward use mediates the relationship between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention to use B-flow USG. The implications of the outcomes are discussed, and suggestions for future research are made."
78,Learning analytics and higher education: a proposed model for establishing informed consent mechanisms to promote student privacy and autonomy,"By tracking, aggregating, and analyzing student profiles along with students’ digital and analog behaviors captured in information systems, universities are beginning to open the black box of education using learning analytics technologies. However, the increase in and usage of sensitive and personal student data present unique privacy concerns. I argue that privacy-as-control of personal information is autonomy promoting, and that students should be informed about these information flows and to what ends their institution is using them. Informed consent is one mechanism by which to accomplish these goals, but Big Data practices challenge the efficacy of this strategy. To ensure the usefulness of informed consent, I argue for the development of Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) technology and assert that privacy dashboards will enable student control and consent mechanisms, while providing an opportunity for institutions to justify their practices according to existing norms and values."
79,Staff and student views of lecture capture: a qualitative study,"Many universities now use lecture capture. We used focus groups to investigate perceptions of lectures and their capture in staff ( N  = 8) and students ( N  = 17). We found that staff and students held different views of lectures and this impacted on their perceptions of lecture capture. Our findings confirmed a range of previously identified uses of lecture capture and additionally demonstrated its use to model expert behaviour. Furthermore, we report here that students felt lecture capture reduced anxiety, particularly for those with disabilities, indicating that lecture capture may be a useful tool in creating an environment that supports mental wellbeing. Despite this potential value of lecture capture, it was still perceived to have some negative impact on the live lecture; reducing the interaction with students and prevent staff using anecdotes and humour in their teaching, which could reduce the value of the lecture capture."
80,The roles of academic engagement and digital readiness in students’ achievements in university e-learning environments,"University students, who are assumed to be digital natives, are exposed to campus e-learning environments to improve their academic performance at the beginning of their academic careers. However, previous studies of students’ perceptions of e-learning demonstrate a lack of consistent results with respect to the prediction of their academic achievement. The goal of this study was to examine university students’ perceptions of e-learning, based on their experiences, and the mediating roles of academic engagement and digital readiness within the university context of an e-learning environment for academic achievement. A total of 614 undergraduate students enrolled in a Korean university participated in this study. Using a partial least squares model to develop the theory, we examined students engaging in university e-learning environments in relation to their perceptions of e-learning, digital readiness, academic engagement, and academic achievement (i.e., grade point average). The results are significant for the importance of students’ academic engagement and digital readiness as mediators in their perceptions of e-learning predicted by academic achievement. Although students positively perceived e-learning experiences on campus, they must have strong digital skills to perform academic work and commit to effortful involvement in the context of academic learning in university e-learning environments. Our results provide practical implications for ways to enhance effective adoption of e-learning environments by college students, educators, and administrators."
81,Case study of creativity in asynchronous online discussions,"It is vital for online educators to know whether the strategies they use help students gain twenty-first-century skills like creativity. Unfortunately, very little research exists on this topic. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether participation in online courses can help students develop creativity using asynchronous online discussions, textbooks, and teacher developed materials. A case-study approach was used and one professor, recognized by her peers for her expertise in online education, and three of her students were interviewed. Asynchronous online discussions (29) were also collected and analyzed using a sequential process of building an explanation, checking the explanation against the data, and repeating the process. Key results from the study indicated that project-based prompts, problem-based prompts, and heuristics used in asynchronous online discussions can help promote creativity. Future research should explore a more diverse group of participants and academic subject areas."
82,Feelings of satisfaction in mature students of financial accounting in a virtual learning environment: an experience of measurement in higher education,"Currently, the usefulness of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) in the teaching-learning process has not been discussed; unlike distance learning, these new tools are used via technologies. The current approach to social development, supported by the exercise of innovation, learning and research, is undeniable. Within this framework, student satisfaction regarding blended e-learning has been studied. However, in distance university models, which are supported by virtual platforms, it is necessary to ask ourselves the following question: are students satisfied when they are not in a face-to-face classroom environment? The objective of this study is to analyse students’ perceptions of their satisfaction levels in a virtual learning environment. In this evaluation, the students’ generic skills were also considered, as well as their perception of the learning environment. The findings of the analysis seem to reveal that students have a high perception of satisfaction, considering students’ perception and learning experience as a proxy of the feeling of satisfaction. Students’ perceptions of the virtual learning environment and of their own skill, which also takes on high values, could have some type of effect on their overall satisfaction. A significant finding is that students with a high positive perception of their generic skills are also satisfied with the learning process and with the virtual learning environment. The validity of the three construct designed to measure the latent variables—feelings of satisfaction, acceptance of the virtual learning environment and students’ self-perception on their generic skills—ensures their usefulness as variables of measurement."
83,Automated Function Analysis for Calculus,"When teaching function analysis, as part of college calculus, many of the same calculations repeat themselves, over and over again. These calculations are for proving limits (their existance and values, or perhaps the lack thereof), finding minima and maxima, determining continuity and differentiability at specific points, or for ranges, etc. We also present to our students, the summary of the analyses, in the form of detailed, annotated plots. We present the automation of function analysis, for teaching first-semester college calculus. The relevant Mathematica functions (and their options) are demonstrated, in a step-by-step fashion and discussed at length. The application of these functions, to the calculus material, and the pitfalls that can arise, are discussed. In addition to the automated results for limits, extrema, continuity, differentiability, etc., we also show how plotting can be achieved, including all of the analyses learned."
84,Technological innovations and practices in engineering education: a review,"Nowadays, universities are teaching students whose main distinctive characteristic is the strong relationship they have with information and communication technology (ICT). They are the millennial generation who have a different learning style and who are most effective when doing multisensory activities. Higher education institutions face a big challenge in finding ways to improve the learning experience and academic performance of these and future students. Research has shown that ICTs used for educational purposes can help in meeting this challenge. In this work, a review of the available ICTs that can be applied in the educational field is undertaken. Additionally, selected universities from the QS World University Rankings by Engineering and Technology Subject 2018 are analyzed. The aim is to review the state of the art technology employed by them and to summarize the innovative technological tools, trends and teaching practices of these organizations for successful engineering education. This research work can be seen as a guide to proven and valuable technologies and educational practices useful to improve the teaching–learning processes in engineering education."
85,Exploring the relationship between college students’ writing anxiety and the pedagogical use of online resources,"This study reports on how the use of online resources based on systemic functional linguistics (SFL) impacted college students’ emotional alignment with writing practices. Through qualitative analyses of in-class discussions, students’ interviews and reflections, as well as their written pieces gathered in a Chinese university, the case study shows that the students were able to overcome their fears with writing construction associated with their dearth of effective knowledge, albeit through a zigzag trajectory. More importantly, they could utilize the knowledge imparted through online resources, actively and confidently participating in unpacking written discourse and effectively constructing their own writing. The study concludes the importance of harnessing online resources that are effectively designed and linguistically grounded. It sheds light on the role of SFL as a linguistic technique to alleviate students’ anxieties while offering them knowledge needed for effective written communication."
86,Nutrition and health as virtual class at Open University (Portugal): pedagogical strategies for higher education,"The Open University is the sole distance learning public university in Portugal. The present paper reflects the work that is carried out in a curricular unit that belongs to the scientific field of nutrition and that is integrated in an MSc degree. The work is based on the pedagogical model of the University and on the process of didactic and pedagogical transposition in the planning of the structure and dynamics of the curricular unit. Distance education now uses the new technologies of information and communication and the process of teaching / learning benefits from a pedagogical model specifically designed to be used with a platform adapted to the needs of the University. The objective of the reflection and of the proposed study, as well as the results presented, was to show that the interaction between students and between the lecturer and the students is not only intensive but is also beneficial for the learning process and the successful outcomes."
87,Investigating self-directed learning and technology readiness in blending learning environment,"Blended Learning (BL) creates a ‘rich’ educational environment with multiple technology-enabled communication forms in both face-to-face and online teaching. Students’ characteristics are closely related to the learning effectiveness in the BL environment. Students’ ability to direct themselves in learning and to utilise learning technologies can affect student learning effectiveness. This study examined the impacts of self-directed learning, technology readiness, and learning motivation on the three presences (social, teaching, cognitive) among students undertaking subjects in BL and non-BL (NBL) settings. The results indicated that the BL environment provides good facilitation for students’ social involvement in the class. Student technology readiness plays a stronger role in impacting the teaching presence in a BL environment than NBL environment. These findings imply that a proper BL setting creates a cohesive community and enhances collaborations between students. Prior training of learning technologies can potentially enhance students’ teaching presence."
88,Benefits and challenges with gamified multi-media physiotherapy case studies: a mixed method study,"Background The use of gamification in higher education context has become popular in recent years with one aim of enhancing learning motivation, yet, it is unknown how physiotherapy students perceive gamified education experience. Using gamification together with multi-media patient case studies, this study explored whether and how gamified education motivated physiotherapy students’ learning. It also investigated how other factors such as class design and mechanics affected gamified experience. Method Six case studies in the subject Neurological Physiotherapy were transformed from paper-based cases to multi-media cases built by iSpring suite 8.1. Simulated, real or animated clients were used. Gamification mechanics such as leaderboards, scoring and prioritisation were embedded in the case studies. These gamified case studies were used in classes with Year-3 students enrolled in this subject. After taking these classes, 10 students participated in two focus groups and 32 students responded to a survey to share their experiences and perceptions on this pedagogy. Results Results showed that students perceived gamified education as motivating since this satisfied their competence and social needs and enhanced their self-efficacy. In addition, authentic patient videos, class activities that allowed conflict resolution and reflection, and the use of leaderboards were enablers in this gamified experience. Conclusion Future gamified education in physiotherapy can provide authentic experience through class designs and gamification mechanics to foster learning motivation. A suggested mapping of gamified lessons for physiotherapy education is provided based on the results of this study."
89,Supporting self-regulated learning and personalization using ePortfolios: a semantic approach based on learning paths,"In the area of e-learning, there are new challenges to be overcome. One of them is to allow students self-regulation of their learning. Within this self-regulation process, students and teachers use technological tools to carry out their tasks. In general, these tools do not consider pedagogical aspects. Emerging approaches propose the use of electronic portfolios and semantic technologies to provide pedagogical characteristics that make tools more user-friendly for both teachers and students. This paper presents a conceptual model of an intelligent system to support self-regulated learning. This model is based on semantic technologies and uses the concepts of learning paths and student e-portfolios. For learning path generation, the system considers the different learning levels that a student should achieve and metrics that measure student progress. In this way, it proposes a learning path with the intention that the student achieves as highest learning level as possible."
90,Blended learning motivation model for instructors in higher education institutions,"Currently, blended learning (BL) is trending among higher education institutions (HEIs) around the globe. Despite its popularity, no model exists that describes the motivation that affects instructors’ opinions and beliefs regarding online learning. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the factors responsible for motivating instructors at HEIs to integrate the BL approach into their courses. Two categories of motivational factors, namely, extrinsic and intrinsic, have been identified in the BL literature. These factors have been used to design a motivation model based on the cause-effect relationship between them. Survey data were collected from 362 HEI instructors in Turkey and North Cyprus for analysis using a structural equation modelling method. The results indicated that both extrinsic and intrinsic motivational factors have a significant impact on the instructors’ motivation to apply the BL approach. However, the extrinsic factor, i.e., “academic workload”, did not influence the instructors’ motivation. In general, the findings confirmed that, the consideration of both extrinsic and intrinsic factors for motivating the application of blended learning has a 79% impact on the adoption of BL. The findings of this study provide practical solutions for educational managers, curriculum designers and faculty members towards creating a cohesive BL environment in HEIs."
91,"Is Bigger, Better? Exploring U.S. News Graduate Education Program Rankings and Internet Characteristics","University ranking systems influence a wide range of educational stakeholders, including students, faculty members, and campus administrators. Of these ranking systems, the U.S. News & World Report ranking of colleges and universities has been the subject of much research. However, little research has examined specific U.S. News disciplinary rankings (such as graduate education) and whether Internet characteristics—such as the popularity of an institutional website—contributes to such a ranking. This study examines relationships between Internet characteristics, institutional characteristics, and the ranking of 69 of the top graduate education programs per U.S. News & World Report 2018 rankings. This examination sought to understand which U.S. News criteria best predicts ranking and whether Internet and institutional characteristics are better predictors of ranking. Regarding U.S. News ranking criteria, results suggest peer assessment best predicts graduate education program ranking. Regarding Internet and institutional characteristics, results suggest institutions with larger endowments ( p  = 0.01) and smaller websites ( p  = 0.05) enjoy better rankings. Considering all U.S. News criteria alongside Internet and institutional characteristics, doctoral admission rates ( t  = 3.30, p  = 0.00) and funded research per faculty member ( t  = − 4.89, p  = 0.00) best predict ranking, but the size ( t  = 2.61, p  = 0.01) and popularity ( t  = − 2.88, p  = 0.00) of an institution’s website also strongly predicts ranking. Implications for theory and future research are addressed."
92,Persuasive technology for enhanced learning behavior in higher education,"Obtaining quality learning behavior requires constant improvement. The development of learning methods often unsupported changes in the behavior of participants. This condition causes reluctance to use new learning methods by some users. Meanwhile, technological developments, especially Web 2.0, have the ability to change the way people communicate and interact. This study used the features and capabilities of Web 2.0 to improve learning behavior. The use of this technology will be adjusted with learning methods, especially online-learning that overgrows nowadays. The concept of an integrated system applied a persuasive strategy to bring persuasion. Modifications e-learning were done by combining the concepts of Web 2.0 and persuasive system. Tests were performed on aspects that affect the user’s intentions by comparing the initial and final conditions after the intervention. The behavior changes were expected to improve user involvement and intention in online learning. The results show that the modified technology by using persuasive concept can improve the users’ intention."
93,An empirical investigation of the antecedents of learner-centered outcome measures in MOOCs,"This research revealed the antecedes of two learner-centered outcome measures of success in massive open online courses (MOOCs): learner satisfaction and learner intention-fulfillment. Previous studies used success criteria from formal education contexts placing retention and completion rates as the ultimate outcome measures. We argue that the suggested learner-centered outcomes are more appropriate for measuring success in non-formal lifelong learning settings because they are focused on the learner’s intentions, rather than the intentions of the course developer. The behavioural measures of 125 MOOC participants who answered a pre- and a post-questionnaire were harvested. The analysis revealed that learner satisfaction was directly affected by: the importance of the MOOC’s benefits; online self-regulated learning - goal setting; number of video lectures accessed; and, perceived course usability. Age and the number of quizzes accessed indirectly effected learner satisfaction, through perceived course usability and through number of video lectures accessed. Intention-fulfillment was directly affected by: gender; the importance of the MOOC’s benefits; online self-regulated learning - goal setting; the number of quizzes accessed; the duration of participation; and, perceived course usability. Previous experience with MOOCs and the importance of MOOC’s benefits, indirectly affected intention-fulfillment through the number of quizzes accessed and perceived course usability."
94,Beyond social chit chat? Analysing the social practice of a mobile messaging service on a higher education teacher development course,"Mobile technology has become for many an essential aspect of everyday life. It has transformed how people interact and is widely adopted by social networks to facilitate communication, support engagement and build collaboration. With reference to Shove et al., (The dynamics of social practice: Everyday life and how it changes, 2012) three element social practice model and Wenger (Communities of Practice: learning, meaning and identity, 1998) community of practice framework, this “insider” research study analyses the norms, behaviours and attitudes of users of a mobile messaging service over a two-year higher education teacher training programme. It also examines the socio-technical interaction between the trainee teachers and the relationship between the mobile messaging application and other communicative practices.. Overall, the findings from this research study suggest that although the concept of a community of practice is problematic, the WhatsApp practice positively shaped the experiences of the trainee teachers on their programme."
95,"Design and investigation of cooperative, scaffolded wiki learning activities in an online graduate-level course","Informed by the literature on community of inquiry, wikis in education, and scaffolding in technology-supported learning environments, this study reports the design, implementation, and investigation of wiki-supported cooperative learning activities in an online graduate-level theories class. The investigation of emerging research questions revealed students’ participation patterns in the wiki learning activities, the relationship between their participation and course performance, and the students’ experiences with the scaffolding strategies designed to support their cooperative activities. The study offers implications for designing and scaffolding wiki-based cooperative learning."
96,"Difficulties in defining mobile learning: analysis, design characteristics, and implications","Mobile learning , or m - learning , has become an umbrella term for the integration of mobile computing devices within teaching and learning. In the literature, however, use of the terms has been unsystematic. The purpose of this article is to critically examine the principles of mobile learning. First, I examine the extant literature with regard to defining mobile learning. Four definitions of mobile learning categories are described: (1) relationship to distance education and elearning, (2) exploitation of devices and technologies, (3) mediation with technology, and (4) nomadic nature of learner and learning. Second, in an effort to provide a basis on which to ground future mobile learning research, I propose a framework of design characteristics for mobile learning environments. Seven design characteristics are identified and discussed. Finally, I present implications for future research and instructional design. This paper contributes to the field of mobile learning by providing researchers more precise ways to identify and describe the characteristics of mobile learning environments, as well as describe the attributes of successful mobile learners."
97,Networked Learning and Postdigital Education,"This paper considers the positon of networked learning in higher education learning and teaching in the postdigital era. The underlying origins and principles upon which networked learning are based can be traced back to the critical pedagogy of Freire and emphasise a critical relationship with the digital, the human and the current socio-political and material higher educational context. We examine the theoretical and practical ideas around networked learning in which connections are forged between learners; between learners and their tutors; and between learning communities and learning resources. We describe two case studies to illustrate the theory, pedagogy and practice of networked learning for contemporary higher education learning and teaching. One from the perspective of the online distant learner and their experience of networked learning; the other from the perspective of tutors, which focuses on the challenges they face in moving into the digital world. We conclude by claiming that the way networked learning has developed in theory and practice means it is an approach and pedagogy that makes it entirely suitable for a postdigital world."
98,Integration of good practices of active methodologies with the reuse of student-generated content,"In this article, we present an integrated instructive methodological approach. We begin with a set of proposals for educational innovation oriented towards active learning that have been tested separately and implemented for various subjects in courses of different levels. The approach integrates the following elements: (1) the dynamic generation of digital content by students and their integration into shared knowledge bases of the subjects involved; (2) the systematic use of quality content, mainly in video format, distributed through online platforms as support for flipped classrooms; (3) peer evaluation to support the development of reflective and self-critical capacities; and (4) systematic collaboration with students and professors from other universities to develop the enumerated activities. The methodology has been tested in a variety of subjects, thanks to its flexibility. In all experienced cases, it has been shown that it is feasible for students to generate enough valuable and reusable content. In addition, students have expressed high levels of satisfaction with the implementation of the proposal."

We reached 120 participants who were college students. Our sample comprised of 63 (52.5%) females and 57 (47.5%) males. We applied convenience sampling technique and an online questionnaire to collect data. Descriptive statistics, multiple regression analysis, and Structural Equation Modelling using IBM SPSS AMOS were utilized. The findings provide that GPA, Personal Use of Facebook for Studying and Socialization, Autonomy Psychological Need, and Academic Procrastination foresee college students’ willingness to use Facebook in their courses. GPA and Personal Use of Facebook for studying are the most influential factors while Autonomy Psychological Need is the least impactful. We also examined the impact of these factors on different educational use types of Facebook: communication, collaboration, resources and material sharing. The results are discussed, and further recommendations for future research and implications are presented in the current study."
